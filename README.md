# Breast Cancer Prediction

Welcome to the "Breast Cancer Prediction" project, developed as part of the 2nd-year engineering curriculum at IT Business School in Nabeul. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze cell data and predict whether a cell is cancerous or not.

## Overview

Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to contribute to the early detection of breast cancer by utilizing machine learning algorithms for cell analysis.

## Tech Stack

This project is implemented using the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

- **Machine Learning**: Various machine learning algorithms are employed for classification.

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.

- **Numpy**: Provides support for numerical operations and array manipulation.

- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for implementing machine learning models and evaluation.

- **Flask**: Used for building a web-based user interface.

- **HTML/CSS**: Design and structure the web interface for user interaction.

- **Pycharm/VS Code**: Popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python development.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for exploratory data analysis and model development.

- **Heroku**: Deployment platform to make the application accessible online.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `webapp/`: Flask application and HTML/CSS files for the web-based interface.
- `model/`: Saved machine learning models for predictions.
- `app.py`: Main Flask application script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application to access the web interface.
4. Upload cell data and get predictions for cancerous cells.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Heroku, making it accessible online. You can visit the live application [here](insert-link).
